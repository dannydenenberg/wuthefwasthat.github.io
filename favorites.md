Here are some lists of my favorite things.
Individual lists are very roughly ordered by how much I like them.

If you have recommendations based on these lists, please let me know!
Also, hope you find some new gems!

## Games

I primarily play [puzzle games](puzzle_games.md) and Super Smash Brothers (Melee and Ultimate).
I also enjoy many board and card games, most notably Dominion.
I play some DDR as well, mainly because it doubles as exercise.
