We typically measure economic productivity in dollars.

Dark economy is stuff like:
- drugs

but also
- depression
Person A might have a otherwise economically similar life to person B, except that they're depressed.
This can be a huge effect on their well-being, and so to the extent that we use economy as a proxy for measuring well-being, we should be aware of this "dark economy"
