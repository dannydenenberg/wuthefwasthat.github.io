When we design systems, it's easy for the system to deviate from what we intended.
A given system is nearly always designed to optimize something which is a proxy for what we actually value.

Moreover, when multiple such systems interact, it can be very difficult to reason about what the resulting supersystem does.
So even with great human oversight over the system creation process itself, we can fail to fix problems.

The rest of this is organized as follows:
- Examples
  - Companies optimizing profit
  - Laws
  - Code
- Fixes
  - Have oversight
  - Design very broadly

# Examples

## Companies

The most obvious example is optimizing profit, which is a proxy for creation of human wealth.

For example, Intuit begins as a company intended to make taxes simpler.
It ends up making quite a profit selling their TurboTax software, which generates a decent amount of value.
Later, it is lobbying against making taxes simpler, due to its want to preserve the values.

In the real world, we also have many such companies interacting with each other.
In aggregate, they are essentially optimizing GDP, which is a proxy for total human prosperity.
But it's clear that while millions buying TurboTax increases GDP, the existence of a complicated tax code is a detriment to human prosperity.

As a more complicated example, trading firms (e.g. proprietary trading groups and hedge funds) began as a way to help make trades happen, providing liquidity for some asset.
This created value - investors could sell or buy the asset more easily when they wanted, and were willing to pay a premium over finding the other side of the market themselves.
But multiple factors cause this to ultimately be a net drain on the economy.
First, as trading strategies got more complicated, it becomes less clear what side effects there are.
For example, hedge funds may boost results at the end of a quarter, so they can convince more investors to invest, or create new articles to affect stock prices.
When short-selling a company's stock, one creates an incentive to decrease the worth of that stock, which may be possible for example by manipulating the markets for other things.

Second, many trading firms compete with each other, causing them to spend an enormous amount of effort reducing trading speeds, generating deceptive patterns to fool others and hide their own actions, etc.
