Intellectual property usually has the property that it creates the most value if made publicly available.
For example, the world would be better off if all pharmaceutical companies released formulas for their drugs, and all software code for software.

I think you could get a much better price, for 2 reasons:
- A company can't capture all the value it creates (some people are willing to pay more than the price)
- A company can't create all the potential value (some people aren't willing to pay the price)


I could imagine the government does this.
